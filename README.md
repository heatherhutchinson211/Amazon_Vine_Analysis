# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
This project involved using Google CoLab, AWS, and SQL in order to analyze a se of data from Amazon Reviews from the Amazon Vine program.  I chose to use the "Movies" dataset to base my analysis on. This dataset was uploaded and transformed.  Four new data frames were created and then uploaded into SQL. 

## Results
After transforming my data, I created four new data frames and uploaded them into SQL, as shown below:
