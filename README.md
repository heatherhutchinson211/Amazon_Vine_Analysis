# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
This project involved using Google CoLab, AWS, and SQL in order to analyze a se of data from Amazon Reviews from the Amazon Vine program.  I chose to use the "Movies" dataset to base my analysis on. This dataset was uploaded and transformed.  Four new data frames were created and then uploaded into SQL. 

## Results
After transforming my data, I created four new data frames and uploaded them into SQL, as shown below:

Questions:
**-How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

Surpisingly, with the dataset I chose to use, there were no vine reviews.

![no vine](https://github.com/heatherhutchinson211/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/no_vine.png)

There were 380604 reviews with vine.

**-How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

**-What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

When filtering using "paid" and "unpaid," I saw that 64% of verified purchases were 5-stars.
